# xG-Delta-PPDA-Analysis
Analysis of the impact of xG Delta and PPDA on football team performance using data-driven methods.
## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project explores the impact of **xG Delta** and **PPDA** on football team performance using data-driven methods. The study includes statistical analysis, visualization techniques, and regression models to understand the correlation between these metrics and league standings.

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- A higher **xG Delta** correlates with better league positions.
- A lower **PPDA** (higher defensive pressure) is associated with improved performance.
- Data was processed and visualized using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

## ðŸ“‚ Project Files

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with data processing and visualization.
- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets used in the study.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning & Data Analysis**
